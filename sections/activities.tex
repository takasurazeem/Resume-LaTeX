\textbf{In my free time you will find me:}
\begin{zitemize}
\item Reading Swift blogs to improve upon myself.
\item Working on an opensource project I am determined to finish for my personal learning.
\item Surfing LinkedIn and congratulating people on their achievements.
\item Cooking some food in kitchen as I enjoy cooking as a hobby.
\item Playing or watching sports like Cricket, yes, some of us in Pakistan have cricket fever.
\item Watchin Netflix.
\item In worst case scenario you wont find me and I will be somewhere figuring out in my mind how can I improve that chunk of code.
